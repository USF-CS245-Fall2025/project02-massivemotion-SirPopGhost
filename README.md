CS 245 Project 02
Implements the four different lists to simulate a star and comets floating around in their given pixels. Once they are out of boundaries, they disappear. 
Lists that were created are ArrayList, Singly LinkedList, Doubly Linkedlist and Dummyhead LinkedList
They start with the name "My" to avoid using the same name java has for the built in lists
